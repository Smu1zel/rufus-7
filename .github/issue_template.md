Checklist
---------
- [ ] I performed a search in the issue tracker for similar issues using keywords relevant to my problem, such as the error message I got from the log.
- [ ] I clicked the 'Log' button (🗒️) or pressed <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>L</kbd> in Rufus, or used [DebugView](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview), and copy/pasted the log into the section that says `<FULL LOG>` below.
- [ ] The log I am copying is the full log, starting with the line `Rufus version: x.y.z` - No part of it has been removed.

Additionally (if applicable):
- [ ] I ran a bad blocks check, by clicking _Show advanced format options_ then _Check device for bad blocks_, and confirmed that my USB is not defective.
- [ ] I also tried one or more of the following:
  - [ ] Using a different USB drive.
  - [ ] Plugging the USB into a different port.
  - [ ] Running Rufus 7 on a different computer.
- [ ] If using an image, I clicked on the `(✓)` button to compute the MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 checksums, which are therefore present in the log I copied. I confirmed, by performing an internet search, that these values match the ones from the official image.
